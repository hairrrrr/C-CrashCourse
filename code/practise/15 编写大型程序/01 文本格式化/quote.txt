  C 	is quirky,  flawed,		and an
enormous success.		Although accidents of	  history
   surely helped,	it evidently	satisfied  a    need
       
       for a system implementation	language		efficient
 enough		to  displace		assembly  language,
yet sufficiently	abstract	and fluent	 to describe
  algorithms  and		interactions   in  a   wide variety 
of	  environments.
